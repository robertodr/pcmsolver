# Change Log

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Time-dependent solvers for real-time time-evolution. The solvers work for
  both the C-PCM and general IEF-PCM. The delayed ASC formulation of Corni,
  Pipolo and Cammi is available with a Debye profile (single transverse
  relaxation time). The real-time time-evolution can also be used in an
  equilibrium framework for the solvent response.
- The input learnt to parse a `RealTime` section for the real-time time-evolution parameters.
  It is now possible to perform real-time time-evolution for systems of point
  charges _via_ the standalone executable.
- The input learnt to parse the additional `ChargeDistribution` section.
  It is possible to specify a classical charge distribution of point multipoles.
  This can be an additional source of electrostatic potential for the calculation
  of the ASC.
- An API function to print the contents of a surface function to the host
  program output.

## [v1.1.1] (2016-03-10)

### Added

- A runtime check to ensure that all atoms have a nonzero radius. API kills
  program execution if this is the case.
- An API function to retrieve the areas/weights of the cavity finite elements.
  The values in the returned array are in Bohr^2. Addresses a feature request
  from @shofener (Issue #13)
- The standalone executable `run_pcm` is now tested within the unit tests
  suite. The tests cover the cases where the cavity is given implicitly,
  explicitly or by substitution of radii on chosen atoms.

### Changed

- Boundary integral operators classes learnt to accept a scaling factor for the
  diagonal elements of the approximate collocation matrices. The change is
  reflected in the Green's funtion classes and in the input parsing. Addresses
  a feature request from @shofener (Issue #16)
- GePolCavity learnt to print also the list of spheres used to generate the
  cavity.
- Different internal handling of conversion factors from Bohr to Angstrom.
- CMake minimum required version is 2.8.10
- Atom, Solvent and Sphere are now PODs. The radii and solvent lists are free
  functions.
- `PCMSOLVER_ERROR` kills program execution when an error arises but does not
  use C++ exceptions.
- `include`-s are now specified on a per-directory basis (see programmers'
  manual for a more detailed explanation)
- Default types for template paramters `DerivativeTraits`,  `IntegratorPolicy`
  and `ProfilePolicy` are now given for the Green's functions classes. This
  reduced the verbosity in instatiating these objects significantly.

### Known Issues

- The new printer in GePolCavity might not work properly when an explicit list
  of spheres is provided in the input.
- On Ubuntu 12.10, 32 bit the Intel compiler version 2013.1 produces a faulty
  library. It is possibly a bug in the implementation of `iso_c_binding`, see
  Issue #25

### Removed

- SurfaceFunction as a class is no longer available. We keep track of surface
  functions at the interface level _via_ a label-vector map.

## [v1.1.0] (2016-02-07)

### Added

- Green's function for diffuse interfaces in spherical symmetry

### Changed

- CMake minimum required version is 2.8.8 (2016-01-08)
- Documentation is now served [here](http://pcmsolver.readthedocs.org/)
